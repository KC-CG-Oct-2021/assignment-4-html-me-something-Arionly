         <h1>Dawning of the Age of Aquarius</h1>
         <p class="funParagraph">As a child growing up in the sixties and seventies, I dreamed of that new utopian world.  In this 2022 world, we, the baby boomers, have solved hunger, poverty, and world peace.  The water and air is pure and clean.  We ride trains and subways that travel speeds over 200 miles an hour, vehicles fly and use garbage for fuel.  We take weekend trips to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
          
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> The 1967 musical Hair, with its opening song "Aquarius" and in 1969, the 5th Dimensions sing the song and hits the top of the charts and the Aquarian age concept is brought to the attention of worldwide audience. The explosion of the hippie culture and New Age movements. A whole generation pushed for the promised a time of peace and harmony where everyone had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

         <h1> Conjunction 21 December 2020, Age of Aquarius </h1>
         <p>Triple conjunction occurs when Jupiter appears to pass Saturn three times, in a zigzag pattern.  The last triple conjunction was on December 31, 1980, then again on March 4, 1981 and final on July 24, 1981. The most famous triplet is the Christmas star or “the Star of Bethlehem” which is said to have occurred during the birth of Jesus. </p>
         
         <p> These five planets follow the same general path as they travel across our Earth’s sky.  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are visible to the naked eye. Conjunctions of planets are of great importance in Astronomy and Astrology. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "A superior conjunction occurs when Earth and the other planet are on opposite sides of the Sun, but all three bodies are again nearly in a straight line... "
         </p> 
         <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects (planets, moons, stars, and galaxies) and relevant phenomena like supernovas, gamma ray bursts, meteors, black holes, comets, and pulsars.  A conjunction, when two astronomical objects appear close to each other in the sky. The phase of a new moon is a conjunction between the sun and moon.    </p>

         <h1>Great Conjunction</h1>
         <p>A conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, when the two planets appear closest together in the sky. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named "great" for being by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets.</p>

         <p>The spacing between the planets varies from conjunction to conjunction with most events 1 to 2.5 times the width of a full moon (30 to 78 arcminutes). Very close conjunctions happen much less frequently and separations of less than 10 arcminutes have only happened four times since 1200, most recently in 2020. </p>

         <h1>Rare Phenomenon </h1>
         <p>An astrological age lasts for 2,160 years. is a product of the earth's slow gyrational rotation. An astrological age is a product of the earth's slow precessional rotation and lasts for 2,160 years.  The main trigger for the emergence of this new age – the exact conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn at zero degrees of Aquarius – happened on December 21st, 2020.  </p>

         <p>On extraordinarily rare occasions, a great conjunction is so close that Jupiter passes directly in front of Saturn. If Jupiter partially obscures Saturn, the event is known as a transit. If Jupiter completely covers Saturn, it is called an occultation.</p>
         
          <p>Over the next 10,000 years, Jupiter will transit or occult Saturn three times: February 16, 7541 (a transit); June 17, 7541 (an occultation); and February 25, 8674 (a transit). </p>

        <h1>Aquarius, the Lyrics of the Great Conjunction</h1>
         <p>The song got it wrong.  In 1967 we were still in the Age of Pisces: the age of compassion and sacrifice for an ideal or others. It was the Age of Christianity and Buddhism. It was also the age of the crusades, the age of iron and steel, slavery in Americas, and World Wars I and II.  Over 50 years to soon and 911 still to occur.  </p>

          <p>The song got it wrong. Yes, the Age of Aquarius: is the age of Brotherhood but Jupiter doesn't align with Mars but Jupiter aligns with Saturn in a great conjunction.  The US Congress is devoid of brotherhood, the US capital was stormed by citizens to deny the peoples vote to count. </p>
          <p>The Age of Aquarius: the age of Reason and Science.  The polar ice capes are melting, the seas are rising, and the seasons are merging and diverging.  We have the science but do we lack the will to get it done and cure the planet?  But there is hope we will get it done before the  next age in 21 hundred plus years or before the planet rebels against us.  </p>
