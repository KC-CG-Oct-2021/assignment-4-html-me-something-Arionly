         <h1>Dawning of the Age of Aquarius</h1>
         <p class="funParagraph">As a child growing up in the sixties and seventies, I dreamed of that new utopian world.  In this 2022 world, we, the baby boomers, have solved hunger, poverty, and world peace.  The water and air is pure and clean.  We ride trains and subways that travel speeds over 200 miles an hour, vehicles fly and use garbage for fuel.  We take weekend trips to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

The explosion of the hippie culture and New Age movements. A whole generation pushed for the promised a time of peace and harmony where everyone had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

         <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. These objects can include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. A conjunction, when two astronomical objects appear close to each other in the sky. The phase of a new moon is a conjunction between the sun and moon.  Conjunctions are phenomena of interest to both Astronomy and Astrology.   </p>
         <p> According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "A superior conjunction occurs when Earth and the other planet are on opposite sides of the Sun, but all three bodies are again nearly in a straight line... Conjunctions of planets with one another are considered of great importance in astrology."

         <!-- Write your HTML in this file! -->
         <h1>Great Conjunction</h1>
         <p>A conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, when the two planets appear closest together in the sky. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named "great" for being by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets[1] (i.e. excluding Uranus and Neptune).
         </p>
         <p>The spacing between the planets varies from conjunction to conjunction with most events being 0.5 to 1.3 degrees (30 to 78 arcminutes, or 1 to 2.5 times the width of a full moon). Very close conjunctions happen much less frequently (though the maximum of 1.3° is still close by inner planet standards): separations of less than 10 arcminutes have only happened four times since 1200, most recently in 2020.[2] </p>
