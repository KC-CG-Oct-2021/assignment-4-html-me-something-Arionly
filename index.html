         <h1>Dawning of the Age of Aquarius</h1>
         <p>As a child growing up in the sixties and seventies, I dreamed of that new utopian world.  In this 2022 world, we, the baby boomers, have solved hunger, poverty, and world peace.  The water and air is pure and clean.  We ride trains and subways that travel speeds over 200 miles an hour, vehicles fly and use garbage for fuel.  We take weekend trips to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

         <p> The 1967 musical Hair, with its opening song "Aquarius" and in 1969, the 5th Dimensions sing the song and hits the top of the charts and the Aquarian age concept is brought to the attention of worldwide audience. The explosion of the hippie culture and New Age movements. A whole generation pushed for the promised a time of peace and harmony where everyone had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

         <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere.

         <h1>Great Conjunction</h1>
         <p>Great conjunction is a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, when the two planets appear closest together in the sky. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named "great" for being by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets[1] (i.e. excluding Uranus and Neptune).
         </p>
         <p>The spacing between the planets varies from conjunction to conjunction with most events being 0.5 to 1.3 degrees (30 to 78 arcminutes, or 1 to 2.5 times the width of a full moon). Very close conjunctions happen much less frequently (though the maximum of 1.3° is still close by inner planet standards): separations of less than 10 arcminutes have only happened four times since 1200, most recently in 2020.[2] </p>

         <p>An astrological age lasts for 2,160 years. is a product of the earth's slow gyrational rotation. An astrological age is a product of the earth's slow precessional rotation and lasts for 2,160 years.  The main trigger for the emergence of this new age – the exact conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn at zero degrees of Aquarius – happened on December 21st, 2020  </p>

         <p>Astrology uses the natural science of astronomy, the movements and relative positions of celestial objects to earth, to discern and predict information about human affairs and events on earth. </p>
