         <h1>Dawning of the Age of Aquarius</h1>
         <p class="funParagraph">As a child growing up in the sixties and seventies, I dreamed of that new utopian world.  In this 2022 world, we, the baby boomers, have solved hunger, poverty, and world peace.  The water and air is pure and clean.  We ride trains and subways that travel speeds over 200 miles an hour, vehicles fly and use garbage for fuel.  We take weekend trips to Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

The explosion of the hippie culture and New Age movements. A whole generation pushed for the promised a time of peace and harmony where everyone had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p>

         <p>Triple conjunction occurs when Jupiter appears to pass Saturn three times, in a zigzag pattern.  The last triple conjunction was on December 31, 1980, then again on March 4, 1981 and final on July 24, 1981. The most famous triplet is the Christmas star or “the Star of Bethlehem” which is said to have occurred during the birth of Jesus. </p>
         <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects (planets, moons, stars, and galaxies) and relevant phenomena like supernovas, gamma ray bursts, meteors, black holes, comets, and pulsars.  A conjunction, when two astronomical objects appear close to each other in the sky. The phase of a new moon is a conjunction between the sun and moon. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are visible to the naked eye.   </p>
         <p> These five planets follow the same general path as they travel across our Earth’s sky. Conjunctions of planets are of great importance in Astronomy and Astrology. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "A superior conjunction occurs when Earth and the other planet are on opposite sides of the Sun, but all three bodies are again nearly in a straight line... "

         <h1>Great Conjunction</h1>
         <p>A conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, when the two planets appear closest together in the sky. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter "overtakes" Saturn in its orbit. They are named "great" for being by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets[1] (i.e. excluding Uranus and Neptune).
         </p>
         <p>The spacing between the planets varies from conjunction to conjunction with most events 1 to 2.5 times the width of a full moon (30 to 78 arcminutes). Very close conjunctions happen much less frequently and separations of less than 10 arcminutes have only happened four times since 1200, most recently in 2020.[2] </p>

An astrological age is a product of the earth's slow precessional rotation and lasts for 2,160 years.

         <p>On extraordinarily rare occasions, a great conjunction is so close that Jupiter passes directly in front of Saturn. If Jupiter partially obscures Saturn, the event is known as a transit. If Jupiter completely covers Saturn, it is called an occultation.</p>

          <p>Over the next 10,000 years, Jupiter will transit or occult Saturn three times: February 16, 7541 (a transit); June 17, 7541 (an occultation); and February 25, 8674 (a transit). </p>
